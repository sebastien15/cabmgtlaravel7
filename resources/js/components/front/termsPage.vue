        <h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">EFFECTIVE JANUARY, 2021</h2>
        <h5 class="text-lg mb-4 font-semibold">Section 1 - Contractual Relationship</h5>
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg">
            <strong>Important –</strong> please read these Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) carefully as 
            they constitute a legally binding agreement (“Agreement”) between you (“Driver” or “Rider” or “User/s”) 
            and  Logistics Software Ltd (“Ornasol” or the “Company”). By using the Ornasol website (collectively, 
            the “Services”), you agree that you have read, understood, accepted and agreed with the Terms. These 
            Terms supersede prior Agreements with you. Ornasol has the right but not the obligation to immediately 
            terminate or modify these Terms or any Services to you at any time for any reason which will be deemed 
            effective upon posting at rideme.ng and your continued access or use of the Services after such posting 
            constitutes your consent to be bound by the new Terms, as amended. You agree that it shall be your 
            responsibility to review the Terms regularly or before you use the Services whereupon the continued use 
            of the Services after any such changes, whether or not reviewed by you, shall constitute your consent and 
            acceptance to such changes. RIDEME DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, AND IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION 
            CARRIER. ORNASOL PROVIDES TECHNOLOGY SERVICES THAT MATCH INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEK TRANSPORTATION (“RIDERS”) 
            WITH PERSONS WHO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS (“DRIVERS”). DRIVERS AND RIDERS ARE 
            COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO HEREIN AS “USERS” AND EACH SHALL CREATE A USER ACCOUNT THAT ENABLES ACCESS TO THE
             SERVICES. IT IS UP TO EACH USER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO LOGIN TO THE SERVICES AND OFFER OR ACCEPT 
             TRANSPORTATION FROM ANOTHER USER AND ANY SUCH DECISION IS MADE IN SUCH USER’S SOLE DISCRETION. EACH OFFER 
             OR ACCEPTANCE OF TRANSPORT SHALL CONSTITUTE A SEPARATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUCH USERS. BY REGISTERING TO 
             ACCESS THE SERVICES, DRIVERS AGREE TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYED 
             BY THE COMPANY. FURTHERMORE DRIVERS COMMIT TO UNDERSTANDING THEIR LEGAL, INSURANCE AND TAX OBLIGATIONS AS 
             AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. For each ride conducted, the Services require destination and pick up information. 
             The Services will display an approximate fare estimate for that specific ride, based on an average incorporating 
             such factors as distance, duration, time of day and location. Riders may view the estimated time of arrival,  
             Driver’s profile and vehicle information for various available Drivers. The Rider has complete discretion as 
             to Driver selection and the Driver has complete discretion as to Rider acceptance.

Charges include applicable (ride) fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes as applicable. Ornasol has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable Charges to the Company’s website.

        </p>
        <p class="leading-8 text-lg">
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li>
                    Ride fees: consist of a base price and incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. A temporary fare increase may be added in the future during peak periods to manage short term demand and supply in-equilibriums. For particularly short rides, a minimum ride fee will apply.
                 </li>
                <li>
                    Payment processing: is facilitated through a third party API.

Ornasol  may also assess a cancellation fee against you if we suspect that you have intentionally delayed/cancelled rides/ disrupt the provision of Services.

                <li>
                    Damage fee: if a Driver reports that a Rider has materially damaged the Driver’s vehicle, the Rider agrees to pay a damage fee to the extent of the damage (as determined by the Driver in their sole discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning.

                <li>
                    Payment authorisation: Riders agree that Ornasol may issue a reasonable authorisation hold, which is not an actual charge against your credit/debit card (“Card”), in order to verify your payment method via a Card. The hold may appear in your statement as “pending”. The authorisation hold is issued as a preventive measure against any unauthorised or fraudulent usage of your Card.
                 </li>
                <li>
                    Other charges: other fees, tolls, and surcharges may apply to your ride, including actual or anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, tolls (and return tolls in select instances), and processing fees for split payments.

                    Refunds: once you have completed a journey using the Service, you are required to make payment in full through cash or card payment whereby your payment will be deducted automatically from your Card and is non-refundable (since the journey has already been provided). If you have any complaints in relation to the transportation, that dispute must be taken up with the Driver directly. Any refunds owed to you as a Rider be they for reversal of a cancellation fee or otherwise shall be applied as a credit to your next ride.
 
                        The Company has the right to suspend the processing of any transaction where the Company reasonably believes that the transaction may be fraudulent, illegal or involves any criminal activity or where the Company reasonably believes a User to be in breach of the Terms.
